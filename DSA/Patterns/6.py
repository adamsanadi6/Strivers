Problem Statement: Given an integer N, print the following pattern : 


Here, N = 5.

Examples:

Input Format: N = 3
Result: 
1 2 3
1 2
1

Input Format: N = 6
Result:
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2 
1

Approach: 

There are 4 general rules for solving a pattern-based question : 

We always use nested loops for printing the patterns. For the outer loop, we count the number of lines/rows and loop for them.
Next, for the inner loop, we focus on the number of columns and somehow connect them to the rows by forming a logic such that for each row we get the required number of columns to be printed.
We print the ‘*’ inside the inner loop.
Observe symmetry in the pattern or check if a pattern is a combination of two or more similar patterns or not.
In this pattern, we run the outer loop for N times as we have to print N rows and since we have to print a right-angled triangle/pyramid which must be inverted, so the inner loop will run from 1 to (N-i)th integer in every row till we reach the Nth row where only ‘1’ would be left to get printed. For eg: in the 1st-row numbers from 1 to N get printed, in the 2nd-row numbers from 1 to (N-1) get printed, and so on.
